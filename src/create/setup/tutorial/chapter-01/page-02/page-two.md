### Divide & Multiply
Writing basic functions continued.

We'll write two more basic functions, this time without any help.

+ write a function `divideOne` divides a number by 1
@test('chapter-01/page-02/task-01')

+ write a function `mutiplyone` that multiplies a number by 1
@test('chapter-01/page-02/task-02')
